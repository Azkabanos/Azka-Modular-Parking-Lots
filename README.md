# Azka-Modular-Parking-Lots
A Cities: Skylines mod that makes EV only parkings actually function as EV only parkings and that changes PlacementMode to Roadside to fix grid snapping of parking assets (as they have PlacementMode set to PathsideOrGround so they don't have pavement in front, because in some circumstances it would leak to the other side of the road).

This mod was vibe coded with ChatGPT idk how to write code - don't use this as an example to make your own mod.
